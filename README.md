## RadioWired

RadioWired is a podcast discovery application. Not sure what to listen to next? Looking for something new? RadioWired will recommend new podcasts based on your content preferences. You can make playlists, favorite new gems, and listen to the latest (and only the latest) episodes! Stay up to date with what's coming in on the wire and find new content.

RadioWired is built with React & Redux, and styled using React-Semantic-UI. The database is maintained by a Rails backend API ([here](https://github.com/jarretbryan/RadioWired-backend)) using the MVC design pattern. RadioWired is powered by the ListenNotes API, and user authentication is managed with JSON Web Tokens.
